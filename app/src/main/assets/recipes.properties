title2=Coconut Barfi
materialDes2=Coconut Barfi is a famous South Indian dessert recipe, made on festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi, Dassehra and Diwali. This coconut recipe is loved by people of all age groups.\n1 cup desiccated coconut\n1 cup rava\n1 cup milk\n1 cup ghee\n1-1/2 to 2 cups sugar\n
procedure2=1) To begin making the Coconut Burfi Recipe, we will first make the sugar syrup. In a medium size sauce pan; stir in the sugar and water with heat on medium. Once the sugar has melted continue to boil the sugar mixture until the liquid reaches a two string consistency.\n2) To know the right consistency - do the cold water candy test. Take few tablespoons of water in a cup; add a drop of sugar syrup to water. If it holds its shape like a softball and doesnot dissolve into water then it is at the right consistency.\n3) Add the grated coconut, and cardamom powder to the sugar syrup. With the heat on medium continue stirring frequently to prevent the mixture from sticking to the pan.\n4) In 10 to 15 minutes, the mixture will thicken and will come away from the sides of the pan. This happens with the coconut releasing its oil.\n5) At this stage turn off the heat and be careful not to stir any longer on heat as the mixture can get over cooked and will not set to the consistency required. The sugar will crystallize making the burfi very hard.\n6) Transfer the coconut burfi mixture to a tray (8 x 8 inch square which has a 2 inch min height) greased with ghee.\n7) Level the burfi mixture. Run a knife to cut into squares and allow it to cool and set on the tray for more than a couple of hours.\n8) Once cooled completely, separate the pre cut Coconut Burfi and serve for festivals and special occasions.\n9) Store the Coconut Burfi in air tight containers in the refrigerator for about 2 weeks.\n10) Serve the Coconut Burfi Recipe (Kopra Pak/ Fresh Coconut Fudge) recipe after your delicious meal of Jodhpuri Aloo, Ajwain Puri and Boondi Raita.\n\n

title4=Coconut Chocolate Chip Cookies
materialDes4=2 cups (280g) all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 1/2 cups (300g) granulated sugar\n1 cup (2 sticks, 227g) unsalted butter, at room temperature\n2 large eggs\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n3 1/3 cups (377g) Desiccated coconut\n1 1/4 (213g) cups semisweet chocolate chips\n
procedure4=1 Preheat the oven to 375DegreeF. Place a rack in the middle of the oven. Line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment.\n2 Mix the dry ingredients: In a small mixing bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\n3 Beat the sugar and the butter: With an electric mixer or in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat together the granulated sugar and butter on medium speed until combined, 30 to 60 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a bowl scraper and the beaters.\n4 Mix in the eggs and vanilla: Add the two eggs and vanilla to the butter-sugar mixture and beat at medium speed until no clumps or streaks remain, 20 to 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beaters.\n5 Mix in the flour: Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed just until almost all of the flour has been incorporated, 20 to 40 seconds.\n6 Mix in the coconut and chocolate chips: Add in the shredded coconut and chocolate chips and beat on low speed until the shredded coconut and chocolate chips are evenly incorporated.\n7 Chill, if needed: If your dough feels very soft or warm at this point, chill the dough for 30 minutes before scooping and baking. This will help the cookies keep their domed shape a better. It's also fine to use the dough right away, but except the cookies to spread a little more than pictured.\n7 Scoop the dough: Use a large cookie scoop (about 4 tablespoons) to scoop the dough out onto one of the baking sheets. Space the cookies about 1 1/2 inches apart. Leave as is for domed cookies, or flatten slightly with the bottom of a water glass for flat cookies.\n8 Bake the cookies: Bake the cookies, one sheet at a time, for about 15 minutes. Rotate your cookie sheet halfway through cooking so the cookies bake evenly. While the first batch bakes, scoop the cookies for the next batch.\nThe cookies are done when the bottoms are golden brown (which you can just start to see around the bottom edge) and the tops feel dry. The cookies will be soft when first out of the oven, but will firm up as they cool.\n9 Cool the cookies: Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nCookies will keep in an airtight container for about a week, or in the freeze for 3 months. (Microwave frozen cookies for about a minute to warm.) You can also freeze the balls of unbaked cookie dough; bake straight from the freezer and add a few extra minutes onto the bake time.\n
